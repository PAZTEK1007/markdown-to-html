        <h3>A funny story</h3>
        <p>When I was a teenager, I used to play video games too much and that complicated my school life :/ but unfortunately for me having a dad who works for an internet provider doesn't help when it comes to playing online games, when the school told him I wasn't in class, he'd cut me off from the internet from his computer at work :D</p>
        <h6>TL;DR</h6>
        <p>Don't play with parents, they're stronger than us!</p>
